# chessstats
Initially this project contains the data and script used to answer the question [Do any grandmasters win more with black than white?](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/32936/do-any-grandmasters-win-more-with-black-than-white) on [Chess SE](https://chess.stackexchange.com). The short [answer](https://chess.stackexchange.com/a/33350/3757) is that yes, there are some (but few) grandmasters that win more with black than white, and it does not seem to be due solely to random causes.

In due time I may add other analysis and data related to chess statistics.
